    <p>Experience real Snap challenges that train critical systems thinkers:</p>
  
    <div class="snap-sample">
      <h3>ðŸš° Snap #001: Flow Switch Failure Diagnosis (Cooling Towers)</h3>
      <p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br>
      Flow alarms trip during blowdown events in a newly installed cooling tower.  
      Chemical feed systems are behaving unpredictably.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Your Snap Challenge:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why might the flow switch trip during blowdown?</li>
        <li>Where should the flow switch and blowdown tee be installed to stabilize flow verification?</li>
        <li>What real-world consequences could occur if this mistake is left uncorrected?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>âœ… Think critically. Protect water, chemicals, and system integrity.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="snap-sample">
      <h3>ðŸ”¥ Snap #005: Wet Layup Wizardry (Boiler/Closed Loop Systems)</h3>
      <p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br>
      Newly constructed piping and cooling systems need protection before full commissioning.  
      Solid nitrite treatment is being used for wet layup during 3+ months of limited circulation.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Your Snap Challenge:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the biggest system risks if wet layup is mismanaged?</li>
        <li>How does nitrite inhibitor and filtration protect system integrity?</li>
        <li>How would you optimize limited circulation to maintain chemical effectiveness?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>âœ… Think like a system protector. Save equipment, save time, save lives.</p>
